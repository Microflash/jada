Vue.js has been on a tear [lately](https://2019.stateofjs.com/front-end-frameworks/). 

What's Vue.js, you ask? üò≤ It is a JavaScript framework to develop user interfaces released in 2014 by [Evan You](https://evanyou.me/). With the core library, you can build the view layer of your application. For more requirements (like routing, state management, etc.), you can use [support libraries](https://github.com/vuejs/awesome-vue#components--libraries). There is a reason why Vue.js declares itself as a *progressive* framework!

## The Strengths of Vue.js

- It is **very approachable**. HTML, CSS, and JavaScript are all you need to know to get started. This makes the learning curve small. The [official documentation](https://vuejs.org/) helps you out when things get fuzzy.
- It is **incrementally adoptable**. It is painless to integrate the core library with other libraries or existing projects. When you need it, you can switch to an elaborate toolchain. Vue.js offers modern opinionated tooling but lets *you* decide how to use it.
- With support for [single-file components](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/single-file-components.html), [reactive change detection](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/reactivity.html), and template syntax, Vue.js is very **flexible and extensible**. It has dedicated support for **[server-side rendering](https://ssr.vuejs.org/)** and sensible opinions on [security](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/security.html).
- The official **documentation is top-notch**. It is clear and very accessible. Even better, it is beautiful üòç (who could have thought!) and continuously improved by the community.

## Performance? ü§î

Vue.js is [pretty fast](https://stefankrause.net/js-frameworks-benchmark8/table.html) compared to React, Angular, and several other frameworks. Check out the comprehensive [comparison with other frameworks](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/comparison.html) and decide for yourself.
